    <h3>My Sample Cover letter</h2>
<p>I am writing in response to the advertised position of a Web/Graphic Designer with The Shaw Academy. Having recently completed a HDip in Mobile Technologies at National College of Ireland, combined with my BSc in Information Systems, I believe I am a good match for this role.
 <p>
  Previously I have worked as a Graphic Designer in Abro Printing Press in Addis Ababa and as an Assistant Content Developer in a Computer Company in the same city. My technical skills include HTML5, and CSS and I have also worked with CorelDraw, Visual Studio and Adobe Photoshop. In my recent studies I have picked up skills in mobile technologies, Object Oriented Software, Multimedia and Mobile Application Development and Database (MySQL). 
</p>
<p>
  I enjoy working in a fast paced environment and communicate well with colleagues and people at all levels. I have an organised approach to my work that allows me to meet the targets and requirements of any work role.
</p>
<p>
  My career goal is to assume a role which allows me to take responsibility for designing, developing and maintaining web/non web applications for a progressive and ambitious company. My range of experience with my ability to be a creative and innovative team player I am available immediately for interview and look forward to your response.
